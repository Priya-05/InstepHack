# EfiMeet - InstepHack
Problem Statement: Build a prototype to capture real time audio

    There has been a permanent shift towards a virtual workplace
    We should be getting the most out of our meetings
        - Summarization
        - Reminders
        - Keypoints
    No more screenshots, no more stopping meetings, just EfiMeet
    Now is a time where stakeholders need to be as attentive as possible
    EfiMeet knows that things happen and distractions are everywhere
    EfiMeet is here to show you that thatâ€™s all right

Getting the Audio Data:
  - Using Microphone 
  -Using Chrome Tab Audio capture
Giving the text data:
  - Transcribes in PDF/Text form
  - Text summary in PDF/Text form

Generating Text from audio:
  - It uses the Speech-recognizer python library and google recognizer to get the text from the file
Generate Summaries:
  - It uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers developed by google) summarizer to generate meaningful summaries. 
  - It also uses BERT to extract certain information from the text(Text mining)
