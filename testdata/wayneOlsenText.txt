Are we still talking about that at the most recent session. We're not going to be getting into the details of what kind of clan gifts are the best can give to talk about this is not a technical session. It's really one we want to have a conversation. The conversation of. What kind of things are appropriate opportunities to open up. The dialogue with a donor. What opportunities do you have to introduce the creditors legacy and jewish community foundation partnership. And hopefully by the end of today session you don't feel you have a few nuggets and a few opportunities for ideas on ways to engage ordonez. Which hoping in this case specifically or not specific but for the most part we told me about donuts that are already engaged in your organization who you want to elevate to the conversation of kane giving. Since you each introduced ourselves we won't. Do that again but i'll just summarize with who's on the phone and what organizations you're representing so we know who he talking to. I wayne will do it provide some comments for 15 to 20 minutes. I will then provide some comments from the jewish community foundation perspective.

So we can afford wayne on the spot anatomy perhaps if you so choose but try to try to hit on wayne. If you have some role play conversations where if you would had over there.

Are you asked me to give you a little bit bio i've been in fundraising for about 16 years i'm a trial attorney by trade. I do a lot of writing on fundraising for crescendo interactive and for a few other forces and i also have a radio show that's harold weekly in alabama soon to be heard regionally maybe. Philanthropy. And everything with a third coming out later this year. Does all of that to say that i'm very fortunate to do what i love and its fundraising. Living a love even more is. Helping other people fundraise better so hopefully we can do that today. Direct me to get started charlene. Okay i want to start by telling you a very quick story and everything i'm going to do today is going to be fairly fast and easy. My very first day on the job i walked in and they told me hear the checks were offended the donors. And i had no idea what they meant i thought it was pretty sophisticated. And knew what i was doing at the fancy trial attorney in here they are having me chesterfield of the donors. What i want you to feel comfortable. Is that you're never going to have all the answers. Heather's always going to be some part of planned giving. That you're not going to know so don't even today there's things that i learned. You never going to know everything. But what part of beginning. The first thing you need to know if frame. Play people i talk to who were curious about incorporating playing giving into their program. Is. They're not really sure how it works or what they need to ask what they need to do and any other point you need to remember is that you're never asking for money even with planned giving especially with planned giving. You're not asking for money. You're really just asking for this person's affirmation that they believe in you. And they believed in the mission. You also have to remember if you hit you set the frame. The person you're talking to. Is on your side. Anything as long as you talk about planned giving. You'll realize it's just as many benefits for the donor as the rest for the organization. What can i help you. Is a separate frame. Remember your area of expertise. It helped build my confidence when i remember. That's what i'm talkin with a donor. They don't expect me to be their attorney they don't expect me to be their accountant. I need to be an expert on the organization i represent. Chhota bheem effective planned giving officer. All the people were with us today. The first and only thing you need to be is an expert on your organization. Be an expert on the friendship circle. Be an expert on the jewish family service. Will be an expert on congregation beth israel. That is what they want and expect of you. Something about some of the plan get the vehicle. Are we expecting you to be an expert on your mission. And point them in directions of time getting. What you to suggest ideas maybe but not not right there will for them. I just want to have ideas. And the one thing i want to pee to put in your pocket and always keep in your pocket. Is it's always okay if always acceptable to say. You know i don't know the answer to that question may i get back to you. Always a preferable answer or response. And giving giving a wrong. Call want you to know you have a friend on the phone with you and that's charlene. Always feel free to call charlene and volunteering charlene call charlene. Get her help you with questions you have about planned giving. Remember to. But if you're in the conversation with a donor. You have permission to talk about planned giving. You have permission to. Soccer.com playing giving might benefit the donor or might help the donor and help the cherry. That's all i have for the framework for remembering going into the meeting. Let me tell you now how you might approach a meeting and make a meeting easier or. An encounter with a donor little bit easier. First thing to remember. Is. Think about what you're going to say. Think about purpose of a meeting. And never feel pressured to say too much or go too fast. It's got to be natural. Example i use i think this is a perfect example for planned giving. Is when i was going on my very first date with my wife. My wife. She was somebody i met at a different event and it's a lot first time alone together on a date. And somewhere in the back of our minds with some level we were both thinking. This is somebody that i want to marry. Call mike be somebody that i want to marry or. The tryout for possible marriage. At no point. During that first meeting did we ever say to each other. Hey you know let's see how tonight goes if it goes well we'll do this again if it goes well we'll do it again and we'll get married if the 50th state goes okay well i'll get married and then in five years we'll have two kids and then we'll move to alabama. No we took it one step at a time and your relationship with a donor. Has to be the same way it has to be a natural progression. And the nice thing is the donor is always going to want to talk to you about. Mission. Planned giving the other things are just things that come along for the ride. And and you have to remember always about the mission. Are some phrases that i've come up with. It might help you transition a conversation you're having. Interplan giving. Example this is calling you been so generous to us with all of your gifts you've given us $10 every year for the last 10 years are you you're always the one we can count on to to donate something when we need it during celebrations things like that. Three years to come at your thought about. A way you can make that a permanent legacy of your life and will always remember you and always said that you'll always be part of the celebration even for decades and centuries to come. Alexis cohen it's been such a privilege to work with you and all your generous giving. Wonder if there's anything else we can explore together it might be even better for you. It might be more beneficial for you than the way you have been giving. Perhaps we should talk about some things that would help you even more. Are some phrases for you to use and these are going to be in the handout you receive. What's your impact is going to be what your legacy is going to be. Talk to your attorney about charitable long-term planning. I thought about including our mission in your will. When you updated. Are other ways of getting or you can also get tax benefits and other things i payments back to you. Mexico and i'm not an expert. But i really appreciate your giving would it be possible for you to work with your attorney. Lady with charlene. What ways you can make it even bigger impact with less money out of your pocket. And including wheels and are methods that. I'm going to give you a secret weapon 2. And this is something i've used many times and you can use this as many times as you wish. And you'll never you'll never go wrong using it. Listen to mrs. cohen. We are trying to. Encourage more donors to include up in their wheels. How do you recommend we do that. Can you treat her as a friend and a colleague. Can you ask her if it's all true there's nothing dishonest about that. And she's going to give you the answer of how you ask her. And at the end of the conversation you say misses calling that's pretty good. i like your advice i'm going to use it. Have you ever thought about you including us in your will. Easy natural transition. Let me rephrase imma give you some more phrases that the talk about an invitation to do more this is the key as you start to feel more comfortable with planned giving. You'll start to hear phrases that are the donors way of opening the door. In the same way going back to the dating situation where my future wife would say things like. You know i could never live in california. Well that would cross her off the list right away cuz i know that that's not going to happen to someday i'm going to live in san diego i know it. Tell your parents that you can get along the way. Broadcast where you're heading. Here are some things that donors will say. That our door opening. to talk about playing getting this is just a sample but you'll get flavor for out cuz i wish i could do more i just don't have the money. I'm so disappointed with my investment but they need to be in cd rates are terrible have you seen the cd rates are. At my house is too big i don't need such a big house anymore. When you walk in and it don't start cleaning up and saying oh i'm sorry the house is a mess the house is so big i wish i didn't have to keep this big house clean anymore. That's a problem for you to think about things that you could do. Ripper a problem for her. You can give a house to you or do a life estate are all these other tools that we won't talk about today but just know they're out there. The things that she can do. To make life better for you and better for her and support the mission of your organization. You'll never go on. My. Using questions that begin with who what where when and why. Why do you give to us. What's the most important thing you see for us in the next 5 or 10 years. Mrs. cohen when do you think we'll be able to build that new. Family life center we've been talkin about. Mrs. cohen. What is the most important thing we do for you. Those are all clues. Questions you can use where you can find out what the donors priorities are. And how you can match the donor's priorities to what you're able to offer. Mainly just listen. Junior wizard owner. Donuts are sophisticated today they have the internet. They have the other research and they making a brochure a week and they mail. You don't have to worry about them knowing what playing getting its reserve are being inundated by other charity. The only thing you have to know is the only thing you have to do is let the dona know that you also are willing to accept. A plan gif imager open to the idea of a plan gif. In addition to. An annual fund after a major get. I try to be brief i tried to be simple. I tried to make it down this with the understanding that. Some of you may have no experience with planned giving but wish to have more. Are just getting started. I'm going to turn it over to charlie now but i hope within questions may have or any guys. Any particular issues you may have that we can solve this for you today. Great thank you and i'll give you each a moment to just catch your breath and we'll move on to the next section. Remember to that if there are questions that you would like for wayne. Or or any of us when we're done i will address those shortly. I want to transfer little bit to jcf and how it relates to your conversations. i appreciate the referral to always call me when i do want to just stress that we're a team here at the foundation that has more than one person being available to do this kind of work. Certainty there are some of us who are more ingrained in every day and we absolutely have jeremy pearl that you will now cfo who's all technical specialist. And i don't have given his credentials but as soon as i stop stop talking about anything that's honey-honey technical. Even i transfer those conversations to jeremy so. Just know that how it would have been level of conversation. Packers or comes up. So, you can call me and i'll be the right resource to direct you to the assistance that is most appropriate but they will be times that you will talk to one or other of us. And also know that as we're working with the owners we to have this very same conversation. Whistle blows all the time and how do we integrate aldona conversations with a plane gift. The concept of okay gif where there was full jcf witches on the less often scale. 2. Working on behalf of as an honest broker all about local jewish organizations which we do all the time in our legacy pain and guitar. Mission to increase pain given for the whole community so remember that would win with the owners were undergoing the same kinds of consideration. How do i bring it up with a person's head of donor advised fund for a long time when's the right time is this the right person who's the decision maker. Am i having a conversation with a bad time of their life. All those considerations i we work with everyday so when we. Provide some. Food for thought and know that we don't think of ourselves as experts that we think was maybe practice that a little bit more than others. So the first know what address is. We must remember that because we talked about current owners the most important thing to do before you start any other conversation is to recognize their current giving. Recognize current giving first. We cannot say thank you enough time so thank you thank you thank you. Always comes before any other conversation because the purpose of a plant gift. Is to really recognize and honor the current contribution way into the future. What's the purpose of the pain get. The paint gift isn't really a stand-alone item rarely does it come from a person who hasn't been a supporter of the years. Now we know it jay faces for me a good example where these unexpected the quest coming from people that perhaps won't even on the radar of the organization. For most of us that's more unlikely. They'll always have great treatment that happens so i think the first hard to remember is that when you go into these conversations the purpose is to honor their current giving. We also know when the data has shown. The people that make a plan gifted coming to a plan gift are more likely to increase their annual giving. That's a statistic that's very interesting but hasn't been showing enough. Because oftentimes developing people fundraisers feel that if i talk to about a planned gift that means i'm deferring. The annual. Quite the contrary. Anybody who cares enough to invest in you in the future is most definitely going to invest in you in the present. So introduced thanksgiving concept off you talk about and recognize all current giving and ways to do that. And to get these will be in the know so we provide you would be something like may i speak with you about how we can honor your current giving off your lifetime. Shops at thank you gift of talked about what we've been doing mission-based and when was talking about. I'm showing them what's going on in the preschool or what event happened at the synagogue or what program is being innovative at jay fizzle the new building. And then i say. May i speak with you about. How we can honor your current given off your lifetime. One of my two of my favorite things to include in every conversation. Is silence. The two times you can do that. The first one is by pausing between questions and. Situations that you possessed so. May i speak with you about how we can honor your current giving off your lifetime. Before we launch into the next sentence of explanation of what that means. Just let them hear that just let them ponder that let them think about that. And that's the first time for you to be silent. The second time for you to be silent. Is when they are speaking. Which provides us the opportunity to display. The movie listen to clues that wayne totalitarian some clues that i'll talk about. Is a way to hear where that don was coming from. Parkside donut feels uncomfortable that they're not in the position to provide more now. Well maybe they are scared now because they send me where they don't have a will. You know there's a statistic that shows that 40% of the population a little without a will. That's a pretty scary statistic for somebody who later on in their years of those anybody should have those that are older. I suddenly realized i don't have a will. So they might feel completely committed to your organization and they really want to support you. Oldest thing in the back of your head is the sphere fact that i don't even have a will i don't know how many of my children that love for the synagogue. So here for the hear those clothes look for those look for the body language ghost. As much as possible you want to be in person. And then once you've allowed that to. Relate to the individual help you stick them a speak with you about how we can all your current giving off your lifetime and you provided a moment to pause. You can add. It cost nothing. Has no minimum. And helps to secure the future of our organization. Do you know the song used three elements. To really tell the whole story. It cost nothing. It has no minimum. It helps to secure the future of organization. Those are the three key components of the conversation. Then we're going to go into each one of those for.
