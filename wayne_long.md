Summary: 
Today we are all very happy to have on the phone with us wayne olson from the wayne olson consulting and the presenter of our program. What kind of things are appropriate opportunities to open up. And hopefully by the end of today session you don't feel you have a few nuggets and a few opportunities for ideas on ways to engage ordonez. Do that again but i'll just summarize with who's on the phone and what organizations you're representing so we know who he talking to. I wayne will do it provide some comments for 15 to 20 minutes. Will definitely have good time for questions to please write them down as things progressed throughout session. If you have some role play conversations where if you would had over there. How would you like to get some ideas of how to approach those objections at will will stephanie make that opportunity available to you. Iso kempinski as you all know i'll stewart of the community jewish family service director of major gifts. The glory coach of the first israel synagogue dennis rate of directors you will know who works because he was rabbi. I rosenthal who has really been involved in our email program for a long time. Wiki the lippman who's the senior development manager and silver circle legacy. And we have neewollah who's representing the san diego jewish academy sd developments. Helping other people fundraise better so hopefully we can do that today. And i had no idea what they meant i thought it was pretty sophisticated. And knew what i was doing at the fancy trial attorney in here they are having me chesterfield of the donors. Play people i talk to who were curious about incorporating playing giving into their program. You're really just asking for this person's affirmation that they believe in you. You'll realize it's just as many benefits for the donor as the rest for the organization. They don't expect me to be their attorney they don't expect me to be their accountant. The first and only thing you need to be is an expert on your organization. What you to suggest ideas maybe but not not right there will for them. Always feel free to call charlene and volunteering charlene call charlene. Get her help you with questions you have about planned giving. Let me tell you now how you might approach a meeting and make a meeting easier or. No we took it one step at a time and your relationship with a donor. And the nice thing is the donor is always going to want to talk to you about. Planned giving the other things are just things that come along for the ride. Alexis cohen it's been such a privilege to work with you and all your generous giving. It might be more beneficial for you than the way you have been giving. What's your impact is going to be what your legacy is going to be. Are other ways of getting or you can also get tax benefits and other things i payments back to you. And this is something i've used many times and you can use this as many times as you wish. And at the end of the conversation you say misses calling that's pretty good. You'll start to hear phrases that are the donors way of opening the door. to talk about playing getting this is just a sample but you'll get flavor for out cuz i wish i could do more i just don't have the money. I'm so disappointed with my investment but they need to be in cd rates are terrible have you seen the cd rates are. At my house is too big i don't need such a big house anymore. You can give a house to you or do a life estate are all these other tools that we won't talk about today but just know they're out there. Mrs. cohen when do you think we'll be able to build that new. And how you can match the donor's priorities to what you're able to offer. Some of you may have no experience with planned giving but wish to have more. Any particular issues you may have that we can solve this for you today. Or or any of us when we're done i will address those shortly. I want to transfer little bit to jcf and how it relates to your conversations. And i don't have given his credentials but as soon as i stop stop talking about anything that's honey-honey technical. The concept of okay gif where there was full jcf witches on the less often scale. Working on behalf of as an honest broker all about local jewish organizations which we do all the time in our legacy pain and guitar. Mission to increase pain given for the whole community so remember that would win with the owners were undergoing the same kinds of consideration. Food for thought and know that we don't think of ourselves as experts that we think was maybe practice that a little bit more than others. Is to really recognize and honor the current contribution way into the future. So introduced thanksgiving concept off you talk about and recognize all current giving and ways to do that. One of my two of my favorite things to include in every conversation. Before we launch into the next sentence of explanation of what that means. Just let them hear that just let them ponder that let them think about that. Parkside donut feels uncomfortable that they're not in the position to provide more now. Well maybe they are scared now because they send me where they don't have a will. So they might feel completely committed to your organization and they really want to support you. Oldest thing in the back of your head is the sphere fact that i don't even have a will i don't know how many of my children that love for the synagogue. So here for the hear those clothes look for those look for the body language ghost. Relate to the individual help you stick them a speak with you about how we can all your current giving off your lifetime and you provided a moment to pause.
